#Practice


1. Print the value at index position 2 and 5 in the followung tuple.

t =  "Start", 76 , 'hello!', 4242, 23, 6, "Bye!", "End"

SOLUTION:

print(t[2])
print(t[5])

2.  Access the value at index position 4 in the following tuple and attempt to add 7 to this value. (You may get a syntax error).

t =  "Start", 76 , 'hello!', 4242, 23, 6, "Bye!", "End"


SOLUTION: 

print(t[4] + 7)

3. Add a tuple of your choice to the above tuple and print it as a nested tuple.

SOLUTION:

Answers will vary. Check if the output contains the nested tuple in the following example.

u = t, (17, 84, 348)
print(u)

4. Check if the number 23 and 14 are in the following set. Print True or False.

nums = {3 , 8, 12, 2, 7, 98, 12, 134, 58, 47, 23, 38, 26, 623, 12, 98, 1009, 879}

SOLUTION:

print(23 in nums)
print(14 in nums)




5. Create a similar set to the one above and try the true/false feature yourself!

Answers will vary. Ensure that there are similar syntax to the solution above.
